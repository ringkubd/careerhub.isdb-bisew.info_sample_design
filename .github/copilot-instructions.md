## Current website is https://careerhub.idb-bisew.info/

## We want to completely replace it with a new UI/UX design and I rely on you to help me with that.

## Use HTML, CSS (bootstrap) and JavaScript to create a new design.

## The new design should be modern, responsive and user-friendly.

## The new design should have the following features:

- A homepage with a hero section, a brief introduction about the website, and a call-to-action button.
- A navigation bar with links to different sections of the website (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
- An about section with information about the website and its purpose.
- A services section with a list of services offered by the website.
- A contact section with a contact form and contact information.
- A footer with social media links and copyright information.

## Use placeholder text and images where necessary.

## Ensure the design is accessible and follows best practices for web development.

## Provide the complete code for the new design in a single file.

## Must be mobile-friendly and look good on all screen sizes.

## Get text, images and color scheme from https://careerhub.idb-bisew.info/ and https://isdb-bisew.org/
